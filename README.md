# FixYourSmartphone
FYS is a 3D-printed box to fix your smartphone on various cylindrical objects, like your forearm, tubes (bikes ?), ...

Thanks to 2 strips of [Velcro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_and_loop_fastener), you can wrap this box on the cylinder, and you can add additionnal Velcro strip to close the box (in order to secure your smarthone)

Warning : FYS is an experimental project. Its build and use is only at your own risk, nobody (except yourself) should be responsible for any problems (for instance, damaging your smartphone or hurting somebody - but not only).

Built with the amazing [OpenSCAD](www.openscad.org) program and set to be used with an Samsung Galaxy S 5, but you can change everything thanks to variables.
